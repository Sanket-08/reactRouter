# React Router Example
This repository contains a simple React application that demonstrates the usage of React Router for client-side routing. It consists of multiple components, including a layout component, a home page, an about page, a contact page, a user page, and a GitHub page that loads GitHub user information.

# Overview
The application uses React Router for handling client-side routing. Here's a brief overview of the main components and routes in the application:

Layout.jsx: This component represents the layout of the application and is rendered for all routes. It provides a common structure for other pages.

Home.jsx: The home page component.

About.jsx: The about page component.

Contact.jsx: The contact page component.

User.jsx: The user page component that takes a dynamic userid parameter.

Github.jsx: The GitHub page component that loads GitHub user information using the githubInfoLoader function.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
